<!-- I enjoyed working on this challenge and learning more about semantic html elements with my partner.  Semantic tags seem to be an important way for web content to be organized, especially so that people who use screen readers (or other non-traditional ways of reading a webpage) are able to quickly navigate around between the main content, attached articles, extra information in asides, etc. I think the aside tag would be very useful to help group information that you want on your webpage, but is not necessarily crucial to the main content.  We stuck our table in there, since it seemed like a good place on a website for a table or graph to be placed.

The web browser will place elements on the webpage based on the semantic tag they fall under (e.g. header info at top, footer info at bottom) and then will organize all remaining information based on the style sheet (if linked) and the organization of the element tags (block elements get a new line, inline elements and nested tags will occur within their parent tag's space).

I liked learning how to create my own snippet in Sublime, I'm sure I will be using this feature to create handy snippet shortcuts in the future!

The concept I found most challenging was just trying to wrap my head around the semantic meaning/significance of some of the tags and when it would be best to use them, e.g. when to use "section" rather than just creating a new header within "main." I think further research will help, but I also think that this is a concept that will sink in the more I create/analyze other html docs, rather than just researching the terms in an abstract way.-->

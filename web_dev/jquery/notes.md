###jQuery research plan
I plan to start with a Google search and explore the top 10 websites it returns.  In my experience, reading one website often leads to other web resources through links, so I anticipate reading more than 10 articles by concentrating on these top 10 search results.  I will take a couple 5 minute breaks so that I don't get overwhelmed, and will use a project file to test jQuery as I learn more about it (I learn best by being able to practice and test theories on my own).

###What worked best:
After googling "jQuery" I quickly realized I needed to be more specific in my search.  Trying "What is jQuery" and "How to use jQuery" produced better results.  Taking notes while I researched was crucial to help me stay organized. I also found it very useful to have two different test projects to experiment on.  I had created an html that I intended to use for all of my practicing, but one of the first websites I visited included a test demo html that I ended up using as well.  It was nice to play around with the demo html without any fear of "messing up" my project, and then once I felt comfortable with what the jQuery script was doing, I could add it to my main project file and experiment with how it worked on my other html.

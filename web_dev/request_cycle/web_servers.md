###In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a private server that exists as part of a larger server. It acts like a separate computer, even though it does not exist physically, and runs on its own operating system. You can purchase a VPS for either a limited or unlimited time. It is more affordable than owning a dedicated server, but affords more autonomy than using shared hosting. When using a VPS, any commands you give it will not affect files on your personal computer (it is therefore very useful to play around with, without fear of accidentally deleting/crashing your own system).  


###Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

It is not a good idea to use the root user to run programs on a Linux system due to increased security risks. If a command is run incorrectly, it can take down the entire operating system and make it unusable.

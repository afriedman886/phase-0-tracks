You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

Command: 
SELECT * FROM reviews, users, businesses WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

Output:
1|3|not as good as my first wedding|1|1|1|Bradford|Pitt|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
2|5|Best.Sushi.EVER!|6|7|7|Denzel|George|6|Sushi World
3|4|great music|3|4|4|Steven|Wonder|3|The Beagle Nightclub


There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

Command:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

Output:
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|not as good as my first wedding
Denzel|George|Sushi World|5|Best.Sushi.EVER!
Steven|Wonder|The Beagle Nightclub|4|great music


How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

Command:
SELECT * FROM reviews, users, businesses WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND businesses.name = "Sushi World";

Output:
2|5|Best.Sushi.EVER!|6|7|7|Denzel|George|6|Sushi World

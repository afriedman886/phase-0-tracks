# Git Definitions

#### Instructions: Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the ability to create multiple copies of a project and work on them simultaneously without affecting the master copy.  Changes can be tracked, and multiple users can contribute to the same project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a new version/copy of an existing file.  Branches are used to add to/edit existing projects, and then can be merged back into the master version once they are complete.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point that is tracked in version control.  A good commit message is specific and effectively describes the change that was made.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when one branch is incompatible with the branch it is trying to merge into.  Merge conflicts must be addressed and corrected before the merge can be completed.
